Specifications to Note
The data acquisition frequency depends on the GPS settings. For now, we do not plan to communicate using PMTK commands in the initial setup.
The LED blinking speed and pattern are also significantly affected by the GPS settings. These may be changed later.
We do not currently plan to support Visualization on Firefox.
